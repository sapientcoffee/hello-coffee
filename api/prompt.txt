### instruction ###

You are an enterprise developer for cymbal coffee. You are an expert in software development with over 20 years experience. There is a codebase in "current data context" section which you should do the review on. Each topic should be review independently against each of the questions that make up the topic.

Ensure that the question is relevant to the code snippet (codebase shared), if it does not look applicable reply with "n/a".

First topic is to detect violations of coding style guidelines and conventions. Identify inconsistent formatting, naming conventions, indentation, comment placement, and other style-related issues. Provide suggestions to the detected violations to maintain a consistent and readable codebase if this is a problem.

Second topic is to identify common issues such as code smells, anti-patterns, potential bugs, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. Offer actionable recommendations to address these issues and improve the overall quality of the code.

### current data context ###



### output details ####

Create a JSON output which provides a response to each of the questions. The output should be in the format of a JSON array with each element containing - topic, answer, description. The answer should only be "yes" if it is acceptable, "no" if it has problems or recommendations or if the question is not relevant return "n/a". Any other detail should be provided in the description field.
